<h2>About Angband</h2>

<p>Angband started life as a game called Moria in the 1980s in a programming language called VMS Pascal, later made the transition to C, as UMoria, and eventually become Angband some twenty years ago in 1994.  To be honest, it's amazing that it's still going, and part of that is because there is an active and vibrant community of players and an always-changing set of active <a href="http://angband.oook.cz/variants.php?ordrd=1">variants</a>, or modified versions, many of which play very differently to Angband.

<p>Angband itself is currently maintained by a rather loose-knit development team, who follow on from a long line of maintainers, hackers and other coders.  Its code is available either under the GPLv2 or the now-archaic Angband licence, which was written before the idea of open source had gained much currency.
